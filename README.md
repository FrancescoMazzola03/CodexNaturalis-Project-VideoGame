Instructions on how to use:  
-You need to download Java  
-You need to downlaod the jar files   
-------------------------------------------------   
ON MacOS:  
-Open the terminal in the folder where the jar files are present  
-write "java -jar ClientJarName.jar" to run the client or "jar -jar ServerJarName.jar" to run the server  
  
if the terminal gives errors try these things:  
-download JavaFX  
-put the javaFX folder in the same one where the jar files are  
-open the terminal in this folder  
-write in the terminal "java --module-path javafx-sdk-22.0-2.1/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar ClientJarName.jar" (where there is "22.0-2.1", it is to be   replaced with the version of JavaFX just downloaded)  
  
-if you still have any problems open the general settings  
-go to privacy and security  
-find "lib" and give it permissions  
-retry the command "java --module-path javafx-sdk-22.0-2.1/lib --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml -jar ClientJarName.jar"
